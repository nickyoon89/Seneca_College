## Week 12 Example

The code example this week contains Two folders "chatApp" and "chatServer":

* "chatServer" contains the completed code for a simple Express app that proviedes the "server" piece for our socket-io driven "chat" application.  It can be executed using the usual command: "node server.js"

* "chatApp" is an Angular application that connects to "chatServer" running locally on port 8080.

By following along with the code in this (completed) example (See the Week 11 notes), you will learn how to use the basic functionality that socket.io offers to create a simple "chat" application.  For the detailed documentation for socket.io, see [https://socket.io/](https://socket.io/)
